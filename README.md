# Spark-IDS

Spark-IDS is an anomaly-based and network-based IDS designed on top of Apache Spark for analyzing big amounts of logs stored in Big Data systems like HDFS.
The pipeline is divided into 3 steps: features extraction, anomaly detection and results inspection. Each of these steps is implemented as a separate command and explained in the section 'Usage'.

## Requirements

- You must have `Apache Spark v2.2.1` or higher installed.
- If you want to add new components (see 'Contributing' section), you need to have `Scala 2.11` and `sbt` installed.

## Installation

`git clone` the project, `cd` into it and follow one of the following :
- Linux with root privileges : run `sh install-ids.sh`.
- Other cases : extract the files from the `spark-ids.tar.gz` archive, copy `jars/ids.jar` to the root of the project and set an alias in your `~/.bashrc` : `alias spark-ids='spark-submit ids.jar'`. Please note that in this case you cannot run it from another directory.

## Usage

You can run 3 different commands :
- `spark-ids extract` : Reads the logs from a specific source and converts them to features according to a specific schema using aggregation for each specific source or destination entity over a specified time window. The features are then scaled and written to a specific parquet file.
- `spark-ids detect` : Reads the previously computed features and apply different anomaly detection algorithms on them to give an anomaly score. The scores are combined into final scores according to a user-defined ensemble technique. The final scores above some specified threshold are considered anomalies. The top n anomalies are written to a csv file.
- `spark-ids inspect` : Reads the previously computed and persisted anomalies and reconstruct the original logs by fetching the original source of logs. A set of user-defined rules are then applied to try to flag the anomalies as true or false positives. The results are then written to a csv file for further investigation.

Each of these commands take parameters that are defined in `conf/application.conf` and can be overriden with command line flags. Execute `spark-ids --help` to see how to use them.

## Contributing

For any change to the code, you need to rebuild the project with `sbt assembly`. If you installed `spark-ids` on your machine, you then need to copy the newly computed jar to the installed jar :
`sudo cp target/scala-2.11/IDS\ Project-assembly-2.0.jar $SPARK_IDS_HOME/jars/ids.jar`

Here are a few possible extensions :
- Create a new entity extractor : in `features/EntityExtractor.scala`, in the `object` create a new `EntityExtractor` as a `val` and add it to the list `extractors`. The `name` field of your extractor will be the string you have to specify in `conf/application.conf` or with the `--extractor` flag in order to use it.
- Create a new kind of intrusion/anomaly : in `evaluation/IntrusionKind.scala`, in the `object` create a new function as a `val` of type `String => IntrusionKind` where the input string is the description of the intrusion kind. Then add it to the list `allKinds`. The `name` field of your intrusion kind will be the string you have to use as name in the json file specified by `intrusions` in `conf/application.conf` or by the `--intrusions` flag.
- Create a new anomaly detection algorithm : the main class of your implementation must extend the `detection.Detector` class. Then in the `object` in `detection/Detector.scala`, add a `case` to return a new instance of your `Detector` in the method `getDetector`. The string of the pattern match should be the name of your `Detector` that you will specify in the `detectors` field in `conf/application.conf` or in the `--detectors` flag.
- Create a new inspection rule : in `inspection/RulesParser.scala`, add a `case` to return your `Rule` in the method `getRule`. The string of the pattern match should be the name of your `Rule` that you have to use in the json file specified by `rules` in `conf/application.conf` or by the `--rules` flag. The parameters of the rule are defined in `params: List[String]`, if you need to parse them to some other data type like `Int`, use proper error handling as in the already implemented rules that involve parsing. `Rule` is abstract so you must implement either a `SimpleRule` (over single log entry) or a `ComplexRule` (over all logs of the anomaly). In case of `SimpleRule`, you should use the generic method `makeSimpleRule` defined in the companion `object`.
