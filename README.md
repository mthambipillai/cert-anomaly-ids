#Spark-IDS

Spark-IDS is an anomaly-based and network-based IDS designed on top of Apache Spark for analyzing big amounts of logs stored in Big Data systems like HDFS.
The pipeline is divided into 3 steps: features extraction, anomaly detection and results inspection. Each of these steps is implemented as a separate command and explained in the section 'Usage'.

##Requirements

- You must have `Apache Spark v2.2.1` or higher installed.
- If you want to add new components (see 'Extend' section), you need to have `Scala 2.11` and `sbt` installed.
