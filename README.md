# CERT-Anomaly-IDS

CERT-Anomaly-IDS is an anomaly-based and network-based IDS designed on top of Apache Spark for analyzing big amounts of logs stored in Big Data systems like HDFS.
The pipeline is divided into 3 steps: features extraction, anomaly detection and results inspection. Each of these steps is implemented as a separate command and explained in the section 'Usage'.
This project was the subject of my Master thesis which you can read [here](https://github.com/mthambipillai/cert-anomaly-ids/blob/master/masterthesis.pdf).

## Requirements

- You must have `Apache Spark v2.2.1` or higher installed.
- you need to have `Scala 2.11` and `sbt` installed to build the project since the jar file is not provided.

## Installation

- `git clone` the project
- `cd` into it
- run `sbt assembly` to create the packaged jar file in `target/scala-2.11/CERT-Anomaly-IDS.jar`
- run the program using `spark-submit target/scala-2.11/CERT-Anomaly-IDS.jar`
- The rpm is not yet publicly distributed so if you want to use a single command (`cert-anomaly-ids` in the next section and in the wiki), then you have to install the command in your `PATH` or create an alias in your `~/.bashrc`.

## Usage

You can run 4 different commands:
- `cert-anomaly-ids extract`: Reads the logs from a specific source and converts them to features according to a specific schema using aggregation for each specific source or destination entity over a specified time window. The features are then scaled and written to a specific parquet file.
- `cert-anomaly-ids detect`: Reads the previously computed features and apply different anomaly detection algorithms on them to give an anomaly score. The scores are combined into final scores according to a user-defined ensemble technique. The final scores above some specified threshold are considered anomalies. The top n anomalies are written to a csv file.
- `cert-anomaly-ids inspect`: Reads the previously computed and persisted anomalies and reconstruct the original logs by fetching the original source of logs. A set of user-defined rules are then applied to try to flag the anomalies as true or false positives. The results are then written to csv files for further investigation.
- `cert-anomaly-ids optimize`: Performs a grid search optimization for the different parameters of a detector. It is not strictly part of the pipeline, it should be used to tune a detector before actually using it.

Each of these commands takes parameters that are defined in `conf/application.conf` and can be overriden with command line flags. `conf/application_loader.conf` defines the path and file name of the configuration (`conf/application.conf` by default. You can override it with your own `.conf` file as long as it defines every parameter like in the default `conf/application.conf`. Execute `spark-ids --help` to see how to use them.
You can find more information about every parameter in the [wiki](https://github.com/mthambipillai/cert-anomaly-ids/blob/master/Wiki.md).

## Example

Consider the following directory structure:
```
.
├── _logs
|   ├── broSSHlogs-jan.parquet
|   ├── broSSHlogs-feb.parquet
├── _features
├── _anomalies
├── _inspections
```
We first extract features from the logs:

`spark-ids extract -l logs/* -f features/featuresSSH`
```
.
├── _logs
|   ├── broSSHlogs-jan.parquet
|   ├── broSSHlogs-feb.parquet
├── _features
|   ├── featuresSSH.parquet
├── _anomalies
├── _inspections
```
Then we use only IsolationForest and KMeans as detectors with a new threshold and only the top 3 anomalies:

`spark-ids detect -f features/features -d "iforest,kmeans" -t 0.75 -n 3 -a anomalies/anomaliesSSH`
```
.
├── _logs
|   ├── broSSHlogs-jan.parquet
|   ├── broSSHlogs-feb.parquet
├── _features
|   ├── featuresSSH.parquet
├── _anomalies
|   ├── anomaliesSSH.csv
├── _inspections
```
Finally we inspect the detected anomalies and get one csv file per anomaly:

`spark-ids inspect -a anomalies/anomalies.csv -i inspections/inspectionresultsSSH`
```
.
├── _logs
|   ├── broSSHlogs-jan.parquet
|   ├── broSSHlogs-feb.parquet
├── _features
|   ├── featuresSSH.parquet
├── _anomalies
|   ├── anomaliesSSH.csv
├── _inspections
|   ├── inspectionresultsSSH-part0000.csv
|   ├── inspectionresultsSSH-part0001.csv
|   ├── inspectionresultsSSH-part0002.csv
```

All the other parameters that we didn't explicitly set as flags were defined in `$SPARK_IDS_HOME/conf`.

## Contributing

For any change to the code, you need to rebuild the project with `sbt assembly`. If you installed `spark-ids` on your machine, you then need to copy the newly computed jar to the installed jar:

`sudo cp target/scala-2.11/IDS\ Project-assembly-2.0.jar $SPARK_IDS_HOME/jars/ids.jar`
